## ‚úÖ Containerization with Docker

- Dockerfile created to containerize the Flask application.
- Image built successfully: `final-app:latest`.
- Docker image pushed to Docker Hub: [`mohamedanter845/flask-app`](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/mohamedanter845/flask-app).
- Container tested and working locally via port `5000`
```

## ‚úÖ Step 3: Deploy Backend App on Kubernetes Cluster (NodePort Service)

In this step, we manually deployed the backend application on a **self-managed Kubernetes cluster** using a combined manifest file that includes both the **Deployment** and the **NodePort Service**.

- The manifest file is located at:  
  `backend/backend-deployment.yaml`
  
- This file includes:
  - üß± `Deployment`: to manage the backend pod(s)
  - üåê `Service` of type `NodePort`: to expose the app internally across cluster nodes

- We applied the manifest using:

  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f backend/backend-deployment.yml

-------
After applying:

The backend pod was scheduled to run on node1

The NodePort service exposed the app on port 30007

We verified the deployment by running curl on node1 and got a proper response
